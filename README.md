## 📖 About the Project

This project explores why customers are leaving a telecom company. We call this "churn". By looking at the data, we want to find patterns and reasons why people cancel their service. This helps the company understand its customers better and find ways to keep them happy.

We use **Python** to analyze the data and create charts that show what is happening.

## 📊 What We Found

We looked at different things to understand churn:

### 1. Who is leaving?
*   **Senior Citizens:** Older people are more likely to leave than younger ones. They might need simpler plans or better support.
*   **Gender:** Men and women leave at about the same rate, so gender isn't a big factor.

### 2. Services
*   **Fiber Optic Internet:** Customers with Fiber Optic internet leave more often. This is strange because it's a premium service. There might be a problem with the price or the connection quality.

### 3. Contracts and Payments
*   **Month-to-Month Contracts:** People with monthly contracts leave the most.
*   **Long-Term Contracts:** People with 1-year or 2-year contracts stay much longer.
*   **Payment Method:** Customers who pay by "Electronic Check" leave more often.

### 4. New Customers
*   **First Year Risk:** Most people who leave do so in the first few months. If a customer stays for a year, they are likely to stay for a long time.
